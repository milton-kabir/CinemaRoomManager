# CinemaRoomManager
Running a cinema theatre is no easy business. The stats will show the current income, total income, the number of available seats, and the percentage of occupancy.
In addition, the program can check: it's not good when a user can buy a ticket that has already been purchased by another user.
So mainly the program performs following functions:
1. Show the seats
2. Buy a ticket
3. Statistics
